resume_header_intro: "<p>I am a mathematician, and I study the solutions to equations and inequalities in whole numbers. These are called Diophantine problems and they’re part of number theory. I use “analytic” arguments which are often fairly elementary, which makes it analytic number theory.</p>
<p>I’ve become interested in something which seems very different: nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations (nonlinear dispersive PDEs). This is a type of mathematical model which describes physical systems from ocean waves to fibre optic cables.</p>
<p>You can read more about my work on my <a href='https://warwick.ac.uk/research/supporting-talent/fellowships/sci-fellowships/ecr/simon-myerson'>Fellowship webpage</a>."
